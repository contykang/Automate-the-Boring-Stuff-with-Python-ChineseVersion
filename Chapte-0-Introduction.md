“You’ve just done in two hours what it takes the three of us two days to do.” My college roommate was working at a retail electronics store in the early 2000s. Occasionally, the store would receive a spreadsheet of thousands of product prices from its competitor. A team of three employees would print the spreadsheet onto a thick stack of paper and split it among themselves. For each product price, they would look up their store’s price and note all the products that their competitors sold for less. It usually took a couple of days.

"我们三个人需要两天才能完成的工作，你两个小时就搞定了。"2000年那会儿，我的大学室友在一家电器零售店工作。有时候，这家商店会从竞争对手哪里获取一份包含成百上千产品价格的电子表格。一个由三个雇员组成的团队会把这个表格打印成厚厚的一摞纸，然后把它们平分给每个人。对于每一个产品，它们会去查看自己商店的价格，然后纪录所有竞争对手售价更低的产品。通常这需要花费几天的时间。
